The class name should be uppercase. 
The variable name and method name should be in smallcase.

public class Resturant {
   private int resturantId;
   private String resturantName;
}

Whenever we are working in LEX , dont make use of Scanner.
You have work with the constant values.

  int roll=1;
  String name="Rajesh";
 
-----------------------------------------------------
In the assessment we have to write the code in LEX only we cannot write it in IDE
and then paste.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In LEX while working just check the output of verify button.
Looking at the testcases. You can make the changes in the code
suppose they have asked you to declare a member as public but 
you are not using the public keyword.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have a good hold on class writing with method writing.

    Object
	  |
	  |
	  |
	Base1
	  |
	  |
	  |
   Derived1  
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
 Observation with Base1 and Derived1:
 1) We have baseDisplay method in the Parent class
    and derivedDisplay method in the Child class only.
 2) display method is available in both the Base1 and derived1.
 3) In the display method:
     * return type of the methods in Base and Derived are same.
	 * method name is same.
	 * parameter are not present.
	So this is an example method overriding. In case of method
    overriding:
     * return type will be same or of Covariant type.
     * method name will be same.
     * number of parameter , datatype of paremeters and sequence
       of parameters in both the methods will be same.
4) The method in the Base or Parent class is overridden and 
    the method in the sub class/derived class/child class is 
    overriding.	
	

public class Base1 {
	
	public void displayBase() {
		System.out.println("I am the display method of the base class");
	}
	
	public void display() {   // overridden method
		System.out.println("I am the display method in the base class");
	}

}

public class Derived1 extends Base1 {
	public void displayDerived() {
		System.out.println("I am the display method of the derived class");
	}
	
	public void display() {  // overriding display method
		System.out.println("I am the display method in the derived class");
	}
}


public class Base1Derived1Main1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Base1 base=new Base1();
		base.displayBase();
		base.display();
		Derived1 derived=new Derived1();
		derived.displayBase();
		derived.displayDerived();
		derived.display();

	}

}


private===>default===>protected====>public

A parent class reference can refer to a child class object.

 public class Parent {
 public void display(){}
 
 }
 public class Child extends Parent {
 public void display(){}
 public void childDisplay() {}
 }
 Parent parent=new Child();
 
 parent.display(); // It will call the display of the Child
 parent.childDisplay(); // Not possible
 // Reference variable is of parent class and object is of Child class or subclass
 
 Only the overridden methods can be called using the parent class reference.
 Any new method created in the child 
 class will not be accessible using the parent class reference.
